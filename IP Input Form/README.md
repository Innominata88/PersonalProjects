# IP Input Form

Working on porting code for user input for an IP address from the original I wrote in Python (using Tkinter) to Javascript. My goal is to reconstruct the all the components from that unfinished project using Javascript for practice and ultimately try to finish the original project as a web app in Javascript versus a desktop application in Python.
